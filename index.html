<p>On that day Shruti was going to her home from hostel, Rohit had holiday, as he used to travel from home daily to college, she thought, he had not come that day to College.
But on that day, to give her surprise he had come and was oftenly asking her where she was, she did get that doubt but was not sure, when get down in the city bus stand, she saw him, yes it was him.
Both were stunned at the moment as till that day, they never saw each other's face so closely, and they never spoke standing face-to-face.
They got bus and sat, fun thing was there were 3 seats and she sat on windows seat, and leaving one seat next to her Rohit sat.
Fortunately one Uncle came and asked Rohit to move so that he can sit on that vacant middle seat, but Rohit moved to that vacant seat, finally sat next to his LOVE.
In the bus they hardly spoke,but enjoyed each other's presence.
In the bus he gave her chocolate, her favorite, she sat eating that in the whole journey
and Yes, that chocolate Wrapper and ticket is still with them.</p>

<p style = "font-size: 25px;"><em><strong>"That fear at the beginning of the meeting, which is called nervousness, never felt before and that sadness at the end when we were sayinh bye to each other , should never come"</em></strong></p>

      They reached the Resort before it opens, so they roamed there in kajoo farm and had some romantic moments, they were speaking so much that even Rohit's friend who also came along with them with his girl could hear their voice.
      Once the Resort opened, they moved in and kept walking toeards one so called waterfalls, where there was hardly they could see water😅
     then they occupied one table and keep talking, meanwhile had some romantic moments too, then had lunch in  their own way.
     Shruti stood on the feet of Rohit's and walked.She sat on his lap.They hugged tightly.Then he dropped her to hostel, and while going back she hugged him on bike, which increased his body temperature.

<div style = "line-height:2;text-align: left;color: white;">
<p>The first movie, they watched together was "Hichki", casting Rani Mukharji.
  They booked the corner seats through BookMyShow.
  They reached the theatre before the show starts, so they spend some time sitting outside the theatre.
  Rohit always wants to watch movies in multiplex when he is going to watch with Shruti, that is only because he gives first priority to her safety.When the show started they moved inside the theatre and there were hardly few people.
  During the whole show, they hardly watched the movie, they were busy in their romance, talk.

    <h3>Some mesmerizing worth cherishing moments</h3>
    <div class="white">
    <p>When Rohit stands infront of Shruti,just to cover her from the piercing sunrays, is the most beautiful thing of LOVE.</p>
    <p>While walking on the footpath, he always make sure that he is on the road side and she is in saferside.</p>
    <p>While travelling, he always gives her, his shoulder to lean on, so lovely😍</p>
    <p>Though Rohit is huge fan of Cricket, when she disturbs him from watching it, he still loves it</p>
    <p>He wears the dresses she chose</p>
